      This project is incredibly precious to me. Itâ€™s the only one that has ever moved me to tears,
      not once, but twice. During the height of the Covid pandemic, HubSpot had to pivot and host
      their three-day marketing conference virtually, reaching over 75,000 people across the globe.
      I was deeply involved in this effort, working on a total of six conferences over a two-year
      span. These included INBOUND 2021 and 2022, as well as the GROW series in both EMEA (Europe,
      Middle East & Africa) and ANZ (Australia & New Zealand) for 2021 and 2022.

      We created what is essentially a large-scale solution to medical device configuration
      management. There's a huge array of devices administrators have to keep track of and maintain
      within hospitals (ultrasounds, MRI, cardiovascular, ventilators, patient monitoring, etc.).
      Most of these have configurations that can be exported/imported and previously it's been a
      very manual process, but they recently figured out a way to do it over the internet but they
      needed a UI. In collaboration with our client, we were able to develop a platform that allows
      them to manage everything from a simple web interface. They handled all of the back-end and we
      simply implement API endpoints.
    </p>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>The UI uses tiles to represent devices in a dashboard</li>
      <li>It incorporates drag and drop functionality to sort and group devices into fleets</li>
      <li>
        There's a social aspect that allows administrators to share fleets, devices and specific
        configurations
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking in to a device reveals detailed information like configuration history and recent
        activity
      </li>
      <li>
        Choosing a specific configuration allows you to edit properties, save, delete, download and
        push to other devices or entire fleets of devices.

      At Active Theory, I created the frontend interface for an internal ChatGPT tool, working
      closely with a backend developer who handled the model integrations. I led the design and
      motion work, shaping the entire user experience from layout to micro-interactions to feel
      intuitive and polished. The tool features three custom-trained models, each tailored for
      specific internal tasks, which users can easily switch between depending on their needs. It
      was a rewarding project that combined thoughtful design with powerful functionality and played
      a key role in streamlining how our team accessed and leveraged AI internally.
