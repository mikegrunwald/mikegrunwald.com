description: We redesigned Patreon.com with flexible, scalable Next.js pages,
  powered by Strapi CMS schemas and a CSS custom properties–based theming system
  that lets content adapt seamlessly to the evolving brand. Rebuilt the site
  header and footer with fully interactive navigation and search, and
  transformed the application directory from static HTML into flexible,
  CMS-driven pages that required minimal tweaking. The result is a polished,
  consistent, and highly adaptable experience across the site.
